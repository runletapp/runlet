Runlet is a cloud-based job manager that offers device synchronization and reliable message delivery in a network of connected devices even after connectivity issues. This repository is where new releases are published, bugs are reported, and features are requested. 

## Download

The desktop distribution includes both the daemon and a full-featured GUI, and is recommended for Linux, Mac and Windows users. The ARM distribution includes only the daemon, and is recommended for resource constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi.
